# Private Room Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

### Core Features
1. **Private Room Creation**
   - Password-protected rooms with SHA-256 hashing
   - Unique 6-character room codes
   - Room creator becomes host automatically

2. **Room Access**
   - Join rooms using room code + password
   - Participant tracking with active/inactive status
   - Real-time participant list updates

3. **Real-time Chat**
   - Text messages with instant delivery
   - File attachments (PDF, DOC, ZIP, etc.)
   - Image sharing with inline previews
   - Code snippets with syntax highlighting
   - Auto-scroll to newest messages

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Added to study_rooms table
ALTER TABLE study_rooms ADD COLUMN password_hash text;
ALTER TABLE study_rooms ADD COLUMN room_code text UNIQUE;

-- Added to room_messages table
ALTER TABLE room_messages ADD COLUMN file_url text;
ALTER TABLE room_messages ADD COLUMN file_name text;
ALTER TABLE room_messages ADD COLUMN file_type text;
ALTER TABLE room_messages ADD COLUMN file_size integer;
ALTER TABLE room_messages ADD COLUMN code_language text;

-- Created storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit)
VALUES ('room-files', 'room-files', false, 52428800);
```

### Storage Bucket Policies
- Participants can upload files to their room
- Participants can view files in their room
- Users can delete their own files
- Files use signed URLs for secure access

### Key Components

#### 1. `src/pages/PrivateRooms.tsx`
- Room creation interface with password setup
- Room joining interface with code + password
- Auto-generates unique room codes
- Password hashing for security

#### 2. `src/pages/PrivateRoom.tsx`
- Main room interface
- Participant list sidebar
- Room code display with copy button
- Leave room functionality
- Message routing to chat component

#### 3. `src/components/PrivateRoomChat.tsx`
- Real-time message display
- File attachment menu (File / Image / Code)
- Image upload and preview
- File upload with download links
- Code snippet dialog with language selection
- Syntax highlighting for code
- Auto-scroll functionality
- Toast notifications

#### 4. `src/hooks/useRealtimeRoom.tsx`
- Fetches initial messages with all metadata
- Sets up realtime subscriptions for messages
- Sets up realtime subscriptions for participants
- Handles message sending
- Returns messages, participants, and sendMessage

### Routing Changes
```typescript
// Replaced old Study Room routes
<Route path="/study-rooms" /> → <Route path="/private-rooms" />
<Route path="/study-rooms/:roomId" /> → <Route path="/private-room/:roomId" />
```

### Deleted Files (Old Study Room)
- `src/pages/StudyRoom.tsx`
- `src/pages/StudyRooms.tsx`
- `src/components/VideoGrid.tsx`
- `src/components/CollaborativeWhiteboard.tsx`
- `src/components/RoomChat.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useWebRTC.tsx`

## Security Features

### Password Protection
- SHA-256 hashing for passwords
- Passwords stored as hash only
- Verification on join requires matching hash

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only join rooms they have the correct password for
- Messages visible only to active room participants
- Files accessible only to room participants
- Participants can only see other active participants

### File Storage
- Private bucket (not publicly accessible)
- Signed URLs with 1-year expiry
- File paths include room ID and user ID for isolation
- RLS policies enforce room participation

## Real-time Updates

### Supabase Realtime Channels
1. **Messages Channel** (`room_messages_${roomId}`)
   - Listens for INSERT events
   - Fetches complete message with profile data
   - Adds to messages state immediately

2. **Participants Channel** (`room_participants_${roomId}`)
   - Listens for all events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Refetches participants on any change
   - Updates participant list in real-time

### Message Flow
1. User sends message via PrivateRoomChat
2. Message inserted into room_messages table
3. Realtime subscription triggers on all clients
4. New message fetched with profile data
5. Message appears in all chat windows
6. Auto-scroll to bottom

### Participant Flow
1. User joins room via PrivateRooms page
2. Row inserted into room_participants (is_active = true)
3. Realtime subscription triggers
4. All clients refetch participants
5. Participant list updates everywhere

## File Handling

### Upload Process
1. User selects file via attachment menu
2. File uploaded to `room-files/[roomId]/[userId]/[filename]`
3. Signed URL generated (1 year expiry)
4. Message created with file metadata
5. Realtime subscription delivers to all clients

### Display Logic
- **Images**: Inline preview with click to open
- **Files**: Icon + filename + size + download button
- **Code**: Syntax highlighted with line numbers

## Console Logging

### Debug Points
- Room initialization
- Message fetching (count logged)
- Message sending (type and metadata logged)
- Message receiving (payload logged)
- File uploads (path and URL logged)
- Participant updates (count logged)
- Errors (all caught and logged)

## Performance Optimizations

### Message Loading
- Initial load limited to 100 messages
- Ordered by created_at ascending
- Profile data joined in single query

### Participant Tracking
- Filtered by is_active = true
- Updated only on change events
- Deduplicated via unique constraints

### File Storage
- 50MB file size limit
- Compressed before upload (optional)
- Signed URLs cached in message data

### Auto-scroll
- Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth scrolling
- Only scrolls on new message
- Preserves manual scroll position

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- Loading states during uploads
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Character counter on message input
- Participant count in header
- Avatar fallbacks for missing images

### Error Handling
- Network errors show friendly messages
- File upload failures allow retry
- Invalid room codes/passwords show clear errors
- Missing data handled gracefully

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode compatible

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Password hashing function
- Room code generation
- File size formatting
- Message time formatting

### Integration Tests
- Room creation flow
- Room joining flow
- Message sending
- File uploading
- Participant tracking

### E2E Tests
- Complete user journey: create → join → chat → upload → leave
- Multi-user scenarios
- Error scenarios
- Network interruption handling

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. Message reactions (emoji)
2. Reply to specific messages
3. Message editing/deletion
4. Typing indicators
5. Read receipts
6. Voice messages
7. Video attachments
8. Screen sharing
9. Message search
10. Export chat history

### Performance Improvements
1. Virtual scrolling for large message lists
2. Image compression before upload
3. Lazy loading for old messages
4. WebSocket connection pooling

### Security Enhancements
1. 2FA for room access
2. Encryption at rest
3. End-to-end encryption for messages
4. Audit logging
5. Rate limiting on uploads

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Renew signed URLs for old files
- Clean up inactive rooms (>30 days)
- Archive old messages (>6 months)
- Monitor storage bucket size

### Monitoring
- Message delivery latency
- File upload success rate
- Active room count
- Storage usage
- Error rates

## Support

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Messages not appearing
**Solution:** Check console for errors, verify RLS policies, ensure user is active participant

**Problem:** File upload fails
**Solution:** Check file size (<50MB), verify MIME type, check storage quota

**Problem:** Participants list not updating
**Solution:** Verify realtime subscription active, check network connection

**Problem:** Signed URL expired
**Solution:** Regenerate signed URL (implement refresh mechanism)

### Debug Commands
```sql
-- Check user's room participation
SELECT * FROM room_participants 
WHERE user_id = '[user-id]' AND is_active = true;

-- Check room messages
SELECT * FROM room_messages 
WHERE room_id = '[room-id]' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;

-- Check storage bucket
SELECT * FROM storage.objects 
WHERE bucket_id = 'room-files' 
AND name LIKE '[room-id]%';
```
